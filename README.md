Hi! ðŸ‘‹

While a few of my old projects still live on Github, most of my work
is now done on [sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org/), where you can
find me at [~parasrah](https://sr.ht/~parasrah/).

Feel free to read my post on [why I moved my projects to
sourcehut](https://blog.parasrah.com/posts/why-use-sourcehut/).

Have a nice day! ðŸ‘‹
