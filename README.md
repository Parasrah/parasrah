Hi! ðŸ‘‹

While a few of my old projects still live on Github, most of my work
is now done on [sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org/), where you can
find me at [~parasrah](https://sr.ht/~parasrah/).

Feel free to read my post on [why I moved my projects to
sourcehut](https://blog.parasrah.com/posts/why-use-sourcehut/).

Have a nice day! ðŸ‘‹

**update 2022-06-24**: I have now deleted most of my repositories on
github to prevent them being scraped by github copilot. If you are
looking for one of my projects, it probably exists on sourcehut.
